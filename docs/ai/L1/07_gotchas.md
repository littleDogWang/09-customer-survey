> High-impact setup and business-state pitfalls.

## Setup Pitfalls

- pnpm 8 does not match lockfile 9; use declared pnpm 9.15.9.
- Missing .env.local values fail doctor; do not log or paste credentials.
- Docker needs a running engine and the public App ID at build time. A runtime-only ID cannot repair an already-built client bundle.
- A private/localhost callback URL cannot be used as a cloud business-tool origin.

## Runtime Pitfalls

The questionnaire and verbal review work without business tools. Answers are not saved and no follow-up is scheduled.

A follow-up flag records need, not permission or a scheduled callback. Ending the survey in the UI stops voice and does not save unsubmitted answers. There is no CRM write, refund or support-ticket update.

Use one Node process and a writable persistent directory for saved results. Set `TOP_TEN_DATA_DIR` to that directory; the default is `.scenario-data`. Ephemeral serverless disk does not provide durable survey storage. For multi-instance use, replace the local JSON store with shared storage.

Keep combined token privileges, StrictMode initialization, toolkit readiness and hook-owned cleanup. A missing transcript is an RTM/event question, not evidence that the model never responded. Tool failures cannot silently fall back to fixture success.

## Documentation Or Contract Drift

The repository identity must be `littleDogWang/03-customer-survey`, while upstream attribution remains separate. Keep invite fields, data paths, time zones, Docker volume behavior and pnpm/verification commands synchronized. Run `pnpm run verify:template` for structure/link drift and the canonical checks for source behavior.
